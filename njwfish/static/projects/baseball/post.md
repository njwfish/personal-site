This paper shows the validity of using player performance histories to predict game outcomes in baseball. We show that player histories (defined as the average performance of the teams a given player has played on, in every game theyâ€™ve played in) are more accurate than betting markets, and at least as accurate as classification algorithms used only with team statistics as features.
