My name is Nic Fishman, I'm an undergrad at Stanford University pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Sociology. I use computers to make facts and technology, and I use history and sociology to try to direct those in directions that do more good than bad. Currently my research is on networks under Jure Leskovec, generative genomics under Anshul Kundaje, and understanding poverty and segregation under David Grusky. I also work on making American politics less bleak with Data for Progress, where I do polling infrastructure and computational modeling of the electorate.
