My name is Nic Fishman, I'm an undergrad at Stanford University studying machine learning. I've lived all over, and eaten good food everywhere. I've run on beaches from Thailand to Nicaragua. I love teaching people how to protect themselves, both online and in the real world, as a privacy activist and a martial arts instructor.

Academically, I'm interested in the spaces we can use machine learning to make people's lives better. That means everything from understanding how we can use machine learning to read and write the human genome to keeping data safe from models with long memories. I'm working on making machine learning secure at <a href="https://github.com/OpenMined" target="_blank">OpenMined</a>. I'm working on understanding structural variation in the genome at the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/12513335/ostrander-group/" target="_blank">Ostrander Lab</a>.
