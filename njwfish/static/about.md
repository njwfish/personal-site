##### About

My name is Nic Fishman, I'm currently a PhD student in Statistics at Harvard University.

I work on building reliable large-scale machine learning systems for science, focused on applications in biology, healthcare, and social science.

Currently I am working on three major applied projects:

1. foundation models for causal perturbation prediction in single cell genomics.

2. dynamic treatment effects and policy learning from medical foundation models trained on electronic health records.

3. non-convex optimization for estimating vote choice in elections with applications in causal inference.

In addition to application-driven work I also work in machine learning and causal inference methodology, critiquing existing approaches and developing new methods for practitioners.
