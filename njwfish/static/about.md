##### About

My name is Nic Fishman, I am a PhD student in Statistics at Harvard University.

I build large-scale machine learning systems for science at the intersection of generative AI and causal inference, focusing on biology, healthcare, and social science.

Currently I am working on three major applied projects:

1. Foundation models for causal perturbation prediction in single-cell genomics.

2. Dynamic treatment effects and policy learning from medical foundation models trained on electronic health records.

3. Non-convex optimization for estimating vote choice in elections, with applications in causal inference.

In addition to application-driven work, I also consider questions about methodology and meta-science, trying to understand how to best use statistics, causal inference, and machine learning to answer scientific questions.
