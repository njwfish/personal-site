##### About

I am a PhD student in statistics at Harvard University.

My research is motivated by two sets of applied questions:

1. **The sociology and politics of knowledge.** How is knowledge produced, disseminated, accepted, and
when does knowledge go on to be institutionalized? Who is doing all that? Who benefits from it?
2. **Engineering biological systems.** How can we engineer biological systems like we engineer digital ones?
Can we improve screening techniques for the effects of (small) molecules on biological systems?

I often find myself in the methodological wilderness because I start by picking specific applications and try to construct the right models that get at the relevant questions, often requiring significant departures from standard modeling practice. This enforces a certain methodological pragmatism: when appropriate I'll break out a Bayesian topic model with a custom Gibbs Sampler or a diffusion model, but I also work on logistic regression and Plackett-Luce models. It also means I'm often left with complicated, non-convex, non-standard objectives which are hard (and fun!) to analyze.

I also think a lot about the sociology, history, and philosophy of science, and particularly the role of quantification, statistics, and computerization in the history of the social and biological sciences.
