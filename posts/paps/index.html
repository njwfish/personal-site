        <h1 id="why-are-pre-analysis-plans-good">Why are pre-analysis plans
good?</h1>
<p>From the classic statistical perspective pre-analysis plans (PAPs)
are a bit weird. Why would the researcher pre-register a plan when,
after receiving the data, they might learn important things which can
improve their study?</p>
<p>We can only see an answer once we realize that researchers are not
just pursuing the ideal of truth, but also competing in the cut-throat
academic market, and as such their incentives are not to figure out
whats true, but rather to get publishable results.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Pre-analysis plans are one way to align these goals, as <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09638">Kasy and Spiess</a> [1] argue in
a recently revised paper. I like this paper! But this post is about
elements of PAPs which they don’t discuss that I think are essential to
understanding when PAPs work and when they don’t. You don’t have to have
read their paper to read this post, it should stand on its own (but the
paper is very readable!).</p>
<p>The tl;dr is that PAPs are great when the estimator is guaranteed to
be consistent since they allow the researcher to use complex analysis
pipelines. But when the estimator might be inconsistent it’s unclear
whether or how PAPs are helpful at all!</p>
<p>Now, before diving in its worth stepping back: PAPs are a relatively
recent innovation, so how did social scientists manage these misaligned
incentices before they were widespread?</p>
<p>One way was by forcing everyone to use linear regression.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The simplicity of linear regression
allows practitioners to have clear intuitions about what is reasonable
in any given study. If we imagine that the workhorse of social science
was random forests, where there are many tuning parameters which matter
a lot to the kinds of results you get, we would be much more worried
that researchers tried every possible tweak to get the results they
want.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I’ll call this kind of p-hacking
specification searching, and its the main thing I’m focused on in this
post.</p>
<p>Specification search is less of a problem in linear regression
because there are fewer degrees of freedom. Restricting research to use
linear regression is a way to try to constrain researchers to produce
“true” rather than merely “statistically significant” findings. It is an
imperfect way to try to align researchers with the knowledge-seeking
ideal, and one that comes with a lot of costs, but combined with
adversarial peer review it is current best practice in observational
social science.</p>
<p>Pre-analysis plans emerge as an alternative in experimental settings.
Instead of having to use a simple tool (like linear regression)
pre-analysis plans allow using complex tools as long as all the dials
are set in advance of seeing the data. So now the researcher can
pre-register a random forest specification and then reviewers can be
confident they didn’t tune the parameters to get the results they
want.</p>
<p>That’s the real trick: <strong>PAPs free us from linear
regression.</strong> They decouple the complexity of a research design
from the researchers ability to p-hack. So PAPs enable researchers use
sophisticated econometric techniques without running into the problem of
reviewer’s (often reasonable!) disbelief.</p>
<p>The more common way of pitching PAPs is by saying they control
p-hacking and specification search. I think this is not a particularly
useful way to think about PAPs, since PAPs only “solve” these problems
in very specific situations, as I’ll demonstrate below.</p>
<p>Now returning to Kasy and Spiess, they provide a fully game theoretic
formulation PAPs and built on top of a particular statistical model. But
the statistical model at the heart of their formulation seems to make it
hard to see some of my central issues with PAPs.</p>
<p>These issues become clear if we think about a simple model of
specification search. We will consider an experiment where we are
interested in estimating the ATE and we will see that the Kasy and
Spiess results are plausible, even if its unclear whether it is actually
compatible with their formulation. Then we will change the estimand to a
linear heterogeneous treatment effect and everything will fall
apart.</p>
<p>My point is that you only perform a specification search if there is
not an a prori correct specification. So to understand PAPs you need to
allow the possibility of mis-specification. Sometimes mis-specification
is not a problem (as in the ATE case), and sometimes it is (as in the
HETE case).</p>
<p>But this will bring us back to the benefit of PAPs I outline above:
we can pre-specify more complex, more flexible research designs that can
try to mitigate the possibility of misspecification. Now this does not
completely dissolve the issue: no matter how smart we are about our
statistics/econometrics it is always possible the data confounds our
priors and our pre-specified plan ends up seeming naive ex post. I think
this is maybe the most interesting statistical question about PAPs: how
do we think about ex post changes or adaptations?</p>
<p>Now on to the math!</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-experiment---the-consistent-case">A simple experiment -
the consistent case</h2>
<p>A researcher has a population of individuals with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensional covariates vectors <span
class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>. They run an experiment, randomly
assigning treatments <span class="math inline">\(T_i \sim
\text{Bern}(\frac12)\)</span> to the population. After the experiment
they observe an outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can assume a simple linear model for the outcome:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_i = \tau T_i + \beta X_i +
\epsilon_i\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is some iid
noise. The researcher wants to maximize their probability of rejecting
the null <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \tau = 0\)</span> in favor of
the alternative <span class="math inline">\(H_1: \tau \neq
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will assume throughout that researchers are restricted to running
ordinary least squares to estimate their effects. This will illustrate
the dynamics of misspecification I discuss above, and we will generalize
all these intuitions below.</p>
<p>Since the researcher randomized <span
class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> they can just consider the truncated
regression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y_i = \tau T_i +
\epsilon&#39;_i\]</span> And this is a consistent estimator (since <span
class="math inline">\(T_i \perp X_i, Y(0), Y(1)\)</span>). But this will
not maximize the chance they reject the null.</p>
<p>If the researcher does not pre-register their analysis they might
search over all possible linear regressions, running the regression
<span class="math inline">\(Y_i = \tau T_i + \beta_S S_{i}
\epsilon&#39;_i\)</span> for every subset <span
class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>, picking the subset of covariates to
include that results in the smallest p-value for <span
class="math inline">\(\hat \tau\)</span>. This will invalidate the
hypothesis test,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> so instead we can force the
researcher to pre-register the subset of covariates they will include in
the regression <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now if we assume <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is sparse
the researcher’s problem is a little tricky. To maximize their power
they want to include only the non-zero components of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, but they don’t know which
components those will be.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the researcher can pre-specify any subset of
covariates and have a <em>consistent</em> estimator for <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the only thing thats tricky is
maximizing their power. So if we assume the researcher has some prior
over which subests of <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> are
likely to be non-zero, its straightforward to see that they will
pre-register their best-guess.</p>
<p>I do not think this model is quite covered by the Kasy and Spiess
paper, which is a bit sad, but its very obviously in the spirit of the
results they derive.</p>
<p>Now there is a very obvious issue here: if we assume <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is sparse and the researcher only
cares about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> they should simply
pre-register an L1 penalty on <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
in their linear regression. Then using standard semi-parametric results
they can build confidence intervals for <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and they should be able to directly
maximize their power. This <em>requires</em> deviating from the standard
linear regression, but since it’s preregistered we don’t have to worry
about the increased number of researcher degrees of freedom involved,
since those are all fixed independently of the data (since they are
chosen before the researchers sees the data).</p>
<h2
id="heterogeneous-treatment-effects---the-inconsistent-case">Heterogeneous
treatment effects - the inconsistent case</h2>
<p>Now lets break things. Let us add a set of new covariates <span
class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> to our model and consider the case
where the researcher is interested in the heterogenous treatment
effect:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_i = \tau T_i + \beta X_i + \zeta Z_i +
\gamma T_i Z_i + \epsilon_i \]</span></p>
<p>Where the researcher wants to test the null <span
class="math inline">\(H_0: \gamma = 0\)</span> against <span
class="math inline">\(H_1: \gamma \neq 0\)</span>. But we have not
imposed restrictions on <span class="math inline">\(\text{Cov}(X_i,
Z_i),\)</span> so in general these covariates can have arbitrary
dependence.</p>
<p>Here our restriction to ordinary least squares creates a serious
problem.</p>
<p>What will the researcher do? It seems like their best hope is to
pre-register a specification they think has the highest likelihood of
being correct, knowing that it might not be realized. Then they get the
data and it might become clear that their pre-registered specification
is incorrect and again via specification search they might find a
specification they think is “better”.</p>
<p>In the previous case the mis-specification was only a problem for the
researcher. It hurt their power, but the reviewer is willing to give up
on some theoretical power since it lets the reviewer guarantee that the
researcher is performing valid statistical tests (I think this is the
core intuition [1] is trying to formalize).</p>
<p>In this case the mis-specification is a problem for the reviewer too,
since if the researcher fails to include a covariate <span
class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> which has a non-zero coefficient
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j}\)</span> then the researcher’s
test for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = 0\)</span> will be
invalid.</p>
<p>This seems like the real objection to pre-analysis plans: that what
the researcher preregistered was their “best guess” at what the right
specification was, but they might be wrong! They might look at the
estimated <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and think that it
is very surprising, e.g. it is insignificant with the wrong sign, which
might prompt them to look at the data again only to realize this
surprisingness is because they left out an important covariate in their
pre-analysis plan which, when included, brings the estimated <span
class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in line with their prior.</p>
<p>The problem is that to the reviewer this is observationally
equivalent to the case where the researcher just tried every possible
regression until they got a significant result.</p>
<p>So what should we do here? Well again the obvious answer, under the
particular model in this case, is to once more use an L1 penalty and
include all covariates, using semi-parametrics to ensure a valid
unbiased estimator for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. And
that’s the point! Double-debiased machine learning has a lot of dials we
might worry about researchers tweaking in observational settings, but
PAPs completely ameliorate these issues because PAPs force these degrees
of freedom to be fixed before the researcher gets the data.</p>
<p>But it’s also worth noting that our L1 penalized model can be
mis-specified too. It might be that there are pairwise interactions, or
three-way interactions. At some point we have to make assumptions to
make inference feasible. But those assumptions might be wrong, and it
might be obvious they are wrong only after the fact. How should we
handle this? Theoretically its very thorny, but maybe in practice its
simple: researchers will explain why the PAP was wrong and argue the new
specification is better, and reviewers will decide whether this is
reasonable. Developing some theory to guide this process would be very
useful though!</p>
<h2 id="generalizing-these-results">Generalizing these results</h2>
<p>I focused on the linear regression case above, but the cases above
can be made fully general by considering misspecification with an always
consistent estimator and a possibly inconsistent estimator. In the first
case we only have concerns about power while in the second we have more
serious concerns about whether we are testing the right null hypothesis.
In the first case the reviewer gets to control specification search
while getting a valid statistical test. In the second the researcher
learns the pre-specified model is wrong, and so specification search is
essentially necessary, but the researcher cannot tell whether the
researcher is searching for the “true” model or just a model that
rejects the null. Maybe the researcher cannot tell either.</p>
<p>Whatever model we posit could be wrong in a way we might not be able
to explain a priori but becomes more clear a posteriori. This is a real
issue with pre-analysis plans especially when researchers are restricted
to “simple” designs, but it carries over to more complex procedures as
well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The central takeaway here is that pre-analysis plans enable
arbitrarily complex statistical procedures to be admissible strategies
in the researcher-reviewer game. The obvious solution to the particular
problems above is “use the right model rather than restricting yourself
to OLS”. But social scientists have been trained (I would argue
reasonably) to not trust methods with too many degrees of freedom. This
is necessary if researchers are not using PAPs since too giving
researchers too many dials to turn makes the problem of specification
search much harder to detect and ameliorate as a reviewer (and it is
already very hard!).</p>
<p>When our estimator is <em>consistent</em> PAPs are magic: since they
completely restrict the researcher ex ante this issue goes away
completely. But when our estimator might be <em>inconsistent</em> its
not clear PAPs can guarantee us very much at all.</p>
<p>The centrality of consistency and complexity seem like really
important points to me! And these are points which cannot really be made
in Kasy and Spiess given the way they have set up their model.</p>
<p>A last point worth making here is that all of this makes
experiments+PAPs really exciting for econometricians and statisticians!
Unfortunately even if a researcher could specify the correct model
deriving “the right test” is often hard. The semiparametrics necessary
to ensure a consistent estimator with correct confidence intervals for
<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in the second case is not
trivial! And this remains a very stylized linear model! This “problem”
is great for econometricians and statisticians who have specialized in
nailing the estimator, given the model. Opportunities for important
collaborations abound!</p>
