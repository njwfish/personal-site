<p>Latour gives an ecology of science in which he notes that almost all science practiced today is practiced only due to a delicate balancing of interests, scientists finding projects that fit into modern interests, almost always within the military or health industrial complexes. This insight, combined with actor network theory, are very close to a number of themes I have previously focused on in Fleck and Kuhn, namely utility-orientation in science as an epistemic foundation especially when considering specialization and the networked structure of belief and and obligations to believe and the ontological problems this creates. I will focus here on the ways Latour develops these ideas, and how they can illuminate or clash with other theorists we have read. </p>
<p>The ecological view of modern science is clarifying: Kuhn (and many philosophers of science) have studied the history of physics, but most actually practiced science today is in the pursuit of new military or medical technologies, and much of that which isn’t is in pursuit of other market-oriented products [^1]. Making this even sharper Kuhn notes in parenthetical: “In the sciences (though not in fields like medicine, technology, and law, of which the principal raison d’être is an external social need) …” (Structure, 15) This seems to be a claim that any field whose primary orientation is external social need is in some sense non-scientific. This is absurd,[^2] and yet I think it is somewhat essential to Kuhn’s project. </p>
<p>As I noted in a previous memo Kuhn, contra Fleck, seems to take the “fitness” of a scientific idea as a rather direct evolutionary analogy: the ideas that are fit <em>are</em> the ideas that are passed down to the next generation. His next move is to carefully examine the ways scientists evaluate competing paradigms and develop a series of arguments about the ways this moment of somewhat-disinterested theory uptake can form a foundation for science’s advantages (see the values arguments in the Road Since Structure). The mistake here is that Kuhn, unlike Latour, stops at the laboratory door (in the sense of SIA, 157). He does not even acknowledge funding as a precondition for science, he does not discuss it <em>at all</em>.[^3] This oversight is pretty significant given the centrality of funding to which paradigms survive. No matter how brilliant the theory it will not make it many generations if its adherents cannot get funding. The fact that most of the money in science goes to research which can be argued to improve medical/war technologies then emerges as a key driver in Kuhn’s evolutionary mechanism, partially decoupling the survival of paradigms from their capacity to gain followers in the value-mediated way Kuhn theorizes. </p>
<p>I now want to argue two things: first that this connection to outside interests can be a kind of epistemic guarantee, and second that it can be a gaping epistemic chasm. </p>
<p>The guarantee will depend on Latour’s version of holism, similar to that developed (independently) by Fleck (Genesis, 9-15, 22, 64-5) and Quine (Two Dogmas of Empiricism): all of the facts we know are connected to each other in various relations of dependence, and that hence no individual statement can be proved or disproved by an empirical test (because an unexpected result will necessarily implicate the whole dependence relation). It is precisely due to these dependencies within facts that the dissenter has to give up questioning the Professor’s methods in the endorphin case: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the doubter tries out these connections [the connections between the fact in question and those facts it depends on], all these other facts, sciences and black boxes come to the Professor’s rescure. The dissenter, if he doubts endorphin, has also to doubt Sephadex columns, HPLC technics, gut physiology, the Professor’s honesty, that of his whole lab, etc. (SIA, 77-8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the dependencies of a result are determined and deemed secure to doubt the result requires doubting one of the things it depends on. But the things it depends on will almost invariably be integrated widely into the technoscientific network of modernity, such that to doubt the results of a modern gravitational modeling becomes doubting the accuracy of missiles, doubting the existence of DNA becomes doubting gene therapies that patients will attest have helped them. Doubt is constrained by what skepticisms you must pick up when you doubt a result. The precise bounds of this question, what other beliefs a specific belief entails, are a contested matter, and one that is itself embedded in social discourse (this view is similar to that developed by the philosopher of language Robert Brandom). This is the sense in which the fact that much science is done in application-oriented contexts according to the interests of the time creates an epistemic guarantee. To the extent the technology of daily practice becomes dependent on the facts produced, clearly those facts are “true” (subject to scope conditions) in an extremely consequential sense. They are dependable enough to be useful.</p>
<p>The sense in which this external orientation creates a problem is perhaps more obvious (and it is possible this is why Kuhn avoided it). Two problems emerge for science here, one is ontological (which is related to epistemic questions given the networked structure of belief) and the other is purely epistemic. Clearly there are many things we might investigate scientifically. Similarly clear is that we do not allocate equal resources across this space of investigable questions. Much of scientific practice is devoted to questions of health and violence which may be a concern for those interested in science as approaching truth,[^4] but there are more immediate issues. The fact that <em>what</em> is investigated is subject to interests means that we may learn facts that are useful to those with money while not learning facts that are useful to those without. One case here might be the preponderance of economic research on the value of police officers on decreasing crime and creating economic value whilst there is almost now work studying how increasing (possibly prejudiced) police presence effects health/education/job outcomes for people in the policed communities. It is possible there would be no effects on these other questions, but we surely do not know. Similarly the effect of drug clinics, homeless shelters, increased social protections are not investigated with nearly the same vigor. Yet the <em>fact</em> that increasing police presence decreases crime is used as a justification for increasing police budgets. This is a clear case where the <em>absence</em> of knowledge is consequential. Further, interests can motivate science to suit themselves. Latour’s account is full of people incentivized to fudge the numbers to produce results that will be able to garner capital. The cases of diet, tobacco, and climate research are all striking cases of this problem in practice. </p>
<p>Both the ontological and epistemic problems are troubling for anyone interested in science as well founded, and it its tempting to say we should get money out of science. Certainly clear funding disclosure should be regulated (it sometimes is). But there may be a tension here: perhaps science’s unreasonable effectiveness is connected to its <em>social use</em>. This seems the logical conclusion of my first argument, but it would imply a tension in different epistemic qualities of science. It’s unclear how big a problem this is. Experiments banning industry funded work from publication would be an interesting test.</p>
<p>[^1]:   See: machine learning research which — when not for military or health purposes — is invariably funded by tech firms to improve their products or more likely their ad targeting</p>
<p>[^2]:   Consider the NIH — where all investigators must explicitly justify their work in terms of the health benefits — the claim that no science is produced by the institution immediately falls apart on inspection of any paper ever produced there.</p>
<p>[^3]:   “Money” occurs once in the text of Structure. The only word starting with “fund-“ is fundamental. There is no mention of grants.</p>
<p>[^4]:   Consider the possibility that there is some unifying theory, out there, which we could discover if we investigated the right questions, but that will never be found because we do not explore widely enough the space of questions we might ask.</p>
