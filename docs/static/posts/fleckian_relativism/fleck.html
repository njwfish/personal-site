<p>Memo II:</p>

<p>Fleck is a brilliant theorist. I started this memo by writing up my annotations; I had to stop on page 97 because I had written up 1100 words of notes. I think the text requires engagement on its own merits, but I want to very briefly note the backward and forward connections to Fleck in sociology and philosophy. Going backward, Darwin, Neitzche, and Weber live in this text. Fleck, like many sociologists of the period, was profoundly influenced by Darwin. The biological analogy for the scientific process weaves its way through the text, often just below the surface. Similarly, the genealogical method infuses Flecks analysis and focus on the history of ideas.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> There are obvious connections between these modes of analysis. Weberian rationalization is deeply connected to Fleck’s analysis of science as an ever specializing process, partially because both are drawing on Darwin, and Weberian depersonalization is central to Fleck’s understanding of scientific culture.<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Looking forward in time Fleck develops and explores a number of ideas often connected to other theorists in the realm of philosophy of science. Because they both draw deeply on Neitzche and are interested in the same subject matter it is perhaps unsurprising how similar Fleck’s analysis of “strands of thought” is to Foucault’s discourse analysis. Fleck also tends to take a “death of the author stance“ with regard to agency in science.<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The various discussions about how paradigms become dominant and how they translate to the public has obvious connections to Gramscian hegemony and “common sense”.<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> When Fleck analyzes the way that thought styles condition the experienced world it is hard not to think about the habitus, and in particular Fleck’s focus on the assumptions that thought styles prevent us from considering contours Bourdieu’s doxa.<sup><a id="ffn5" href="#fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> There are also deep connections to Quine: the image of a set of beliefs (both within the individual and within society) as an interconnected network is particularly striking, as is Fleck’s alternate development of holism. In a similar vein, Fleck’s discussion of beliefs as variously constraining each other presages the Converse on political belief systems.<sup><a id="ffn6" href="#fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Finally Fleck’s gives compelling rejections of the “no-miracles argument”. (of course our present ideas explain the world in ways superficially similar to past ideas, the former are descendents from the latter which have been carefully tuned to resemble the world in the ways that we expect them to).<sup><a id="ffn7" href="#fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> This response could be an elaboration of any of these connections, but I think that would fail to really engage with Fleck. Instead I want to explore three interrelated ideas. I want to understand Fleck’s relativism. To that end I am interested in his utility oriented conception of science and his development of the modern scientific mood. Exploring these issues will lead us through many of his important ideas. Finally I want to briefly discuss ontology, facts, and misinformation, which I think Fleck’s account gives unique insight to.</p>

<p>Fleck is not only a relativist, his thought style analysis is actually compatible with Bloor’s notion of symmetry: it is competent to explain the “success” of concepts without reference to their truth character. Fleck actually also sees this as fundamental to epistemological projects (22). This opens Fleck up to a common critique of relativism: “show me a relativist and I’ll show you a hypocrite at 30,000 feet”. The height is a reference to the cruising altitiude of commercial airplanes, the implication is clear: if everything is relative why do the planes fly? Bloor addresses this specific question in his aptly titled “Relativism at 30,000 feet”, which is a mostly successful response. But I think a sharper version of the objection can be posed with a bit more formality.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The material well being of many people has rapidly increased over the last several centuries.</li>
	<li>Much of that increase comes from rapid technological development. </li>
	<li>Much of that technological development has roots in scientific institutions.</li>
	<li>An exploration of science must be able to explain what is different about the particular scientific institutions that have led to this increase in material well being.</li>
	<li>Because of relativism’s focus on the causes of belief uptake it obscures these central questions of the consequences of belief uptake: the consequence of uptake of a more false belief is likely to be qualitatively different from a true belief, and their consequences in wider society are also likely to be different.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this objection clearly has some traction against the strong program. To some extent this is Latour’s critique, and how science impacts society has certainly been central to STS since Laboratory life. Fleck’s relativism has two distinctive features that make it apt to address these questions: first is his focus on utility and ontology, second is his description of the “institutional imperatives” of science. </p>

<p>Fleck’s relativism is rooted in the biological alalogy. He explains that the brontosaurus, outside its ecological context, cannot be “adapted” to anything; ideas are the same way (22). They are adapted to the “intellectual interests” of scientists, to the problems scientists <em>want</em> to solve, conditioned on the history of concepts up to that point, and enabled by the methods for investigation the community has agreed on. This comes part-and-parcel with Fleck’s underdetermination:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It might be claimed that so whereas a large number of somewhat hazy ideas have emerged throughout history, it is science that has accepted the “right” ones and rejected the “wrong” ones. But such an objection is untenable <em>since it cannot explain why there are so many possible “correct” representations of unknown objects.</em>(25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Precisely because representation is underconstrained we can only judge representations by their aptness to solve particular social problems for particular people in their particular contexts.<sup><a id="ffn8" href="#fn8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> New measurements might constraint the set of representations, changing the state of the possible. Different representations might enable different kinds of solutions to problems. Different problems might give rise to different representations and new things to observe, new ways of measuring. Importantly this means that there is a normative dimension to all science: <em>what problem are you trying to solve?</em> The question must echo through analysis. Curing syphilis is noble, even if it is pursued as one front in a multisided (cultural) war between Germany and France for positions on the imagined hierarchy of imperial powers.<sup><a id="ffn9" href="#fn9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Making the atom bomb perhaps less so, even if it is nominally oriented towards ending WWII. The centrality of utility means that Fleckian macro-analysis will need to address 1-4 sketched above. The “needs” of society must be deeply understood to analyze what is scientifically investigated. In modern capitalist economies in imperial/colonial countries a very particular set of incentives have dominated. There is money to be made and a consumer base to sell to, as well as a labor force (often abroad) which can be made to work for cheap. There is state investment in technology and science in the hope of bringing some edge in the endless series of conflicts for imperial domination. An analysis from a Fleckian lens would need to ascertain precisely how these somewhat abstract directives were manifested in scientific institutions, how they were mediated by and shaped the dominant thought styles, and then how they produced facts that would eventually become agricultural techniques and home appliances. </p>

<p>Fleck’s particular account of the “institutional imperatives” (to use Merton’s phrase) of the particular thought style most associated with science is vital to this analysis. Fleck takes three tenets as essential. </p>

<ol>
	<li>Science is the pursuit of the most information possible, its supreme law is to maximize experience. (51, 144)</li>
	<li>Scientists pursue <em>elaboration</em>: developing the greatest number of possible connections between different concepts on the assumption that this brings the structure more in line with truth. (144)</li>
	<li>Scientific discourse has an inclination to objectivize, which emerges somewhat mechanistically out of the scientific process. (144) </li>
	<li>Science is focused chiefly on clear communication between members of a thought collective.</li>
</ol>

<p>Modern science could be said to be distinctive to the extent its institutions promote these imperatives. Arguably many incentive accounts, like Merton and Hull and the further game theoretic extensions of them, offer explanations for how modern science is oriented towards 1 and 2. Further, Fleck describes the rituals required to become indoctrinated into a community, the ways of perceiving the give experiments meaning and the give rise to the limitations required to experiment, and the legitimation process, the construction of legible and legitimate facts consistent with the present store of knowledge that can be incorporated into that store which are the preconditions for 2; without these there would simply be a sea of information impossible to process or connect.<sup><a id="ffn10" href="#fn10" class="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>One of Fleck’s central micro social contributions is to explain the third imperative. This explanation is deeply connected to Weberian rationalization, and therefore also to modern neo-institutionalist theory (like that developed by John Meyer and his students). Fleck takes science as a social project, not a rational one. This means that simultaneously “an ultimate or fundamental set of principles from which [scientific] findings could be logically constructed is … nonexistent“(51) and that “epistemology without historical and comparative analysis is no more than an empty play on words.”(21)<sup><a id="ffn11" href="#fn11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> It seems that there is some disconnect across levels of analysis here. Fleck has shown that science is anything but impersonal (contra Merton) and yet objectivization emerges out of and surrounds scientific institutions nonetheless. If individual scientists are emotional, if in fact emotionless thinking is meaningless (49), then where does this seemingly objective character emerge?<sup><a id="ffn12" href="#fn12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> For Fleck it comes out of the process of communication and especially through the passing of concepts through a though collective that this distance is bridged. This is how points 3 and 4 are intertwined: it is through the scientific communication that concepts are depersonalized, that technical (dead) terms are introduced, and that results are quantified whenever possible, to further develop the vividness of the image whilst ensuring it is static. So communications are depersonalized and depersonalizing, driving objectivization and abstraction as concepts are passed from one member of a thought collective to another (143).<sup><a id="ffn13" href="#fn13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> It is precisely in this way that facts emerge as stylized thought constraint: constraining because they condition what can be thought, stylized because they necessarily fail to capture many important nuances.</p>

<p>Taking both the notion of utility that emerges from a study of society and these features of the modern scientific mood, Fleck offers a compelling analysis of what has enabled the advances in material conditions we have seen in modernity. The interaction of these two ideas makes this even clearer: the telos of connection in modern science — 3 above — means that when science is either down steam or upstream integrated into other scientific theories or into technology the constraints encountered in those possibly distant domains can be made to bind on the originally produced facts. Facts that are not useful in those other domains are likely to be relegated by the though collective that produced them because the continued promotion and promulgation will detract from the thought collective’s legitimacy, funding, and interconnectedness in the wider scientific community and society.<sup><a id="ffn14" href="#fn14" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Facts are one of the most important ideas in Fleck’s micro story. Many scientists carry around many facts in their head that they use to make sense of their measurements and to evaluate new theoretical ideas. These facts are often the central shared assumptions of scientific fields: the central dogma in biology, the rational actor in economics, the stability of party loyalty in political science. Of course any practitioner will acknowledge these facts are not “really true” there are exceptions, but they will argue that these facts are “useful”. And when people argue about science they will often argue using established facts. A fact emerges as something concrete you can point to and build on. Often facts make analysis possible. If proteins add information back into the genome straightforward analysis is replaced by complex feedback loops. If people are not rational economic modeling becomes intractable. If party identification is not stable there is no way to understand how “partisan” groups change over time. But more interesting than any of this is that facts dominate conversations. Especially in the public sphere facts emerge as <em>true</em> and then do combat in political arguments. And facts, especially those produced by different disciplines, can appear contradictory (or even be contradictory). Facts often become <em>reasons</em>, and this is when they are most potent. If raising the minimum wage hurts employment (a now-contested economic fact) then that is reason enough not to pursue it. Facts fo not cover the world though, they pepper it. They are sprinkled here and there, leaving huge gaps in our understanding and always lacking nuance. When this comes into contact with the ontology of science it can become hugely probematic. If the tobacco industry can pay to produce wrong facts that’s a problem, but one we might hope to resolve. If someone produces facts in sparsely studied domains that become uncontested reasons for acting, the danger is just as great, but much harder to detect.</p>

	<li id="fn8">Fleck claims, like many biologists and economists, that in competitive/evolutionary processes the agents embedded in the process are always “optimal” for their particular situation. This often obscures important questions about the actual nature of competition (is it tight?) and tends to require either over-broad definitions of “optimal” hidden inside seemingly narrow concepts like profit maximization or passing on ones genes or a refusal to acknowledge inefficiencies. It also tends to reify the process in question, preventing imenent critique. Is what is optimal within the market <em>what should be optimal?</em> Fleck does not escape these common problems with evolutionary theories, but it is not my focus here. <a href="#ffn8">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
	<li id="fn9">. <a href="#ffn9">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
	<li id="fn10">Without diving too deep into condition, thought styles are the mediator of perception. This is necessary for Fleck, because otherwise the world is simply too information dense to be processed or considered at all. Therefor even as they limit the space of what can be considered thought styles facilitate the exchange of ides and make experimentation possible. <a href="#ffn10">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
	<li id="fn11">This insight prompts Fleck to ask why philosophers are so desperate to demonstrate the latter, given its falsity, leading him to develop one of his key ideas: the phenomenology of thought style as the phenomenology of certainty. 

		<p>“Whatever is known has <em>always</em> seemed systematic, proven, applicable, and evident to the knower. Every alien system of knowledge has likewise seemed contradictory, unproven, inapplicable, fanciful or mystical.” (22)</p>

		<p>To take Wooten’s example: the man who believes that rats spring spontaneously from piles of hay is not simply confused. He has evidence! He has never seen rats copulating, and yet wherever there is hay there are rats. The phenomenology of thought Fleck explores is inextricably bound to his conception of cognition and thought style, but that is a topic unto itself and one I think others will likely explore in their responses. <a href="#ffn11">&#8617;</a></p>
	</li>
	<li id="fn12">Again I am trying to steer clear of Fleck’s cognitive theory, but the concept of striving for closed systems can be smoothly integrated here. <a href="#ffn12">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
	<li id="fn13">There is an interesting project to be embarked on drawing out Fleck’s notion of science as a conversation always <em>towards consensus</em> within a given community and Brandom’s ideas about conversational score keeping and socially binding ideas together as implicating each other (e.g. if you are pro-life you must support ending the death penalty). This would seem to give both an inter and intra community picture of scientific communication, and could likely be integrated into the later-Kuhn’s linguistic framework for scientific translation.  <a href="#ffn13">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
	<li id="fn14">One of Fleck’s major failures is a failure to analyze the between collective power dynamics and the between collective integration of facts. I think this is an artifact of a time when physics and biology, for example, really did not interact. Obviously we no longer live in that world. Bringing power in is straightforward and fits Fleck’s focus on ontological questions. Incommensurability is more difficult. It can be made commensurate with the reality of interchange, and in fact the discursive analysis lends itself quite nicely to this kind of theorizing, especially if oriented around analogies (like Hesse), but like Bloor’s relativism above I worry that the centrality of incommensurability makes asking these kind of questions from a Fleckian framework harder. This is to some extent why I have downplayed it here. <a href="#ffn14">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
